# Rostand's Portfolio

This branch contains the *Front* source code for my personal portfolio. It has been designed to showcase my skills, projects and experience as a web developer.

## Technologies utilisÃ©es

- **Tailwind CSS** : CSS framework for fast, responsive styling.
- **TypeScript** : JavaScript superset offering static types for more robust development.

## Lancer le projet

Install TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss
    npx tailwindcss init
```

Build production CSS and JS files

```bash
    npx tsc --watch
    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./build/css/output.css --watch
```

## Full project

I decided to run the whole project on Symfony, which you'll find on the main branch.
